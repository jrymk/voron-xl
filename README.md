# Voron XL
A Voron 2.4 style toolchanger with no compromises

New rails, new extrusions, it is not a Voron mod I'm afraid

### Requirements
not features, but I will try to fulfill these. nothing is really finalized yet

- full 350x350x350mm print volume (motion ability is probably X355 Y440 Z360)
- fully enclosed, with foam insulation and acrylic front door
- reasonably sized enclosure, with no super tall wire looms like on the Prusa XL or WP-DAKSH. That is why I went with Voron 2.4 style gantry, totally inspired by the Stealthchanger and Tapchanger. Also the tools are parked further out so you don't lose any build volume, and it tensions the tubes and wire when inactive
- extended motion ability. Yes, this will require new rails, new extrusions, and new belts. However, the space we gain below the parked toolheads can be used for circulation fans, chamber heaters, and maybe even the electronics bay. With a standard Voron 2.4, basically NONE of the volume inside the printer is usable, because it is either taken up by the flying gantry, the toolhead, or the PTFE tubes.
- chamber heater. don't install it if that triggers you, but PTC heaters, without flammable stuff right in front of it, can hardly cause fire, especially with a thermal fuse. Even if the fan fails
- another heated chamber, for the filament storage/dryer
- maybe optimized belt paths, maybe AWD due to the longer belts from the extended motion ability, maybe 9mm belts
- oh wait the toolchanger, not really sure, but I think it'll be powered by electro magnets, for maximum DIYability, mechanical longevity, and simplicity. Not trying to build the lightest toolhead, fastest printer here. I'm not spending hundreds for the hotend (and remember to multiply that by 6), so a Bambu clone will suffice, therefore extreme accelerations isn't needed here. Also, as a 350mm printer, the X beam and rails will dominate the toolhead weight, so yeah... it's fine. A little servo latch, or a XL style slider could work, but ehh... mechanical... not confident in that.
